# CPPBigInteger
A C++ realization of big integer and rational classes using long-arithmetics

This is a learning project for MIPT lessons. Now it's in development stage.

`biginteger.h` is the main file

`helper.h` is a file with functionality for testing

`main.cpp` is a file with tests

`one_file` branch is a branch where all the logic code is in one file `biginteger.h`

There also will be `master` branch with code divided into different files.

To use file write `#include "biginteger.h"`

To run tests type `make test`
